                        <p>This site explores the effect of match-score on cube decisions by presenting cube-action data for <i>all</i> scores in 13-point match, all at once.  Instead of peeking at a data point here and there (Hey XG, what about this score?  What about that score?), see the pattern as a whole.  Insights abound.</p>

                        <p>In the example at right, for a given position in the first game of a 13-point match, a correct initial double yields a small pass (a .010 error if taken).  For that same position a correct recube to 4 would be a correct take, whereas a recube to 8 would be a blunder (.209 error) and massive Take.</p>

                        <p>Backgammon cube action is hard, and match-play cube action is harder. At different scores the same position can swing, drunkenly, from No-Double-Take through Double-Pass on its way to Too Good to Double.  How is a player to navigate?</p>
                        <p>Historically, there have been two primary methods:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Do the math
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Memorize a Match Equity Table</li>
                                        <li>Account for gammons</li>
                                        <li>Account for recube equity</li>
                                        <li>Calculate Take Point</li>
                                        <li>This method is best explicated in Kit Woolsey's "How To Play Tournament Backgammon"</li>
                                        <br>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Memorize dynamics of specific scores
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Treat each score as an atomic entity:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Here's what I know about -2-3</li>
                                                <li>Here's what I know about -2-4</li>
                                                <li>Etc.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>For each score, understand:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Doubling Window</li>
                                                <li>Gammon Price</li>
                                                <li>Recube Strategy</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>This method is best explicated in Kit Woolsey's "Five Point Match"</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        There are pros and cons to each method.  Doing the math requires memorizing a match equity table, retrieving the appropriate values over the board, then performing mental long division as needed.  This is a high barrier to entry for many players.  Additionally, the result of the process is not necessarily the value you're looking for -- the initial result assumes no gammons or recubes.  Adjusting for gammons adds another level but is straightforward.  Adjusting for recubes can be complex.</p>
                        <p>The problem with memorizing specific scores is that there are a lot of them.  We tend to get very familiar with the five-point match, but how many people memorize the doubling window of a recube to 4 at six-away nine-away?  Not many.</p>
                        <p>The reality, especially in this blessed era of clocks, is that very few players do more than one or two match-equity calculations per match.  Instead, we rely on a few familiar scores and a bunch of vague heuristics:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Treat roughly even scores greater than seven-away the same as Money.</li>
                            <li>At uneven scores, non-gammonish initial cubes are largely similar to money, but gammons and higher cube levels require big adjustments.</li>
                            <li>Etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    These heuristics can be helpful, but should be examined, tested, and refined.  That's what this tool is for.</p>

                        <legend>Early Observations</legend>
                        <p>The following are some of my early observations after first playing with the data.  They serve as illustrations of how to use this tool to ask and answer questions about match-play.</p> 
                        <p>To start, select the first deck: Borderline Take/Pass: No gammons. The first position up is a pure last-roll 25% borderline Take/Pass.  Its particular value here is that the data line up perfectly with a standard match-equity take-point calculation, since there are no gammons or recubes to account for.  In other words, this position illustrates how the raw MET calculations behave over the full range of scores.<p>
                        <p>Click Next to see the next position -- a medium length race that is also borderline Take/Pass, this time with 21.6% wins, the rest of the take made up by recube equity.  We will switch back and forth between these positions.  (Note that the name of each position is displayed at the bottom of the Money data under the position.  Also note that to the right of the name is a Favorites button.  You can add non-contiguous positions -- say from different decks -- to Favorites and then run the Favorites deck for easy one-click comparisons.)</p>

                                <legend>Doubles from 2-away</legend>
                                    <p>Back to position #1.  Make sure Sort D is selected and scroll to the bottom of the table to see the data where 2-away doubles.  On the take side, you should see a whole column of big red numbers: -.3, -.4, -.5 and the like.  You don't want to give 2-away a 75% chance to win with perfect efficiency, so instead you pass.</p>
                                    <p>Click Next for position #2, looking at the same 2-away data rows.  Now there are a mix of takes and passes, and the passes are of smaller magnitude.  There are two differences between the positions:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The taker in #2 wins less often (21.6% instead of 25%).</li>
                                            <li>The taker in #2 gets an automatic recube to 4.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    The two differences act in opposite directions and generally the second difference is greater than the first.  But only when the second difference applies!  At -2,-2 the taker doesn't get to recube and at -2,-3 the taker doesn't get full value from the recube.  So those are big passes.  At -2,-4 the trailer gets perfect value from the recube and the initial double is an error.  -2,-5, -2-6, and -2-7 are all passes, but -2,-8 is a take, perhaps because winning takes the trailer to -4, which I understand to be particularly valuable.
                                    </p>
                            </fieldset>

                                <p>If it's so bad to take an initial cube when the doubler is 2-away, what about taking a recube to 4 when the doubler is 4-away?  Scroll up to the 4-away rows and look at the second group of columns: -4,-3 through -4,-7 are passes, but trailing -8 or more are takes.  (I did not know this.  I would have guessed they were all passes.)  Compare to position #2 where the recube is active and see that -4,-3 to -4,-5 are still passes, -4,-6 is a take, and when the taker is further away the recube is a blunder.  That's pretty different from what we saw when the doubler is 2-away and all scores are proper doubles except -2,-4.  (Ah, perhaps part of that difference is cube ownership.  Two-away is doubling from the center whereas 4-away must own the cube and accordingly gives up more by doubling.)</p>

                                    <p>What can we see when 2-away is taking?  We could look at the bottom row of each section of the table, but instead click Sort T (sort by taker) and scroll to the bottom of the table.  For position #1 we see that -2,-2 and -3,-2 are passes, but all other scores are hefty takes.  Again, it's good to go out (win) efficiently with no risk of overage.  Compare to position #2 and now we see a mixture of close takes and passes.  Now there's only one difference between the positions in that the taker will never recube in either case, so the efficiency of winning two points is offset by winning 21.6% instead of 25%.  (Again, I did not know this.  I knew that -4,-2 and -5,-2 were big takes, so assumed all the others were too.)
                                    </p>
                            </fieldset>

                                <legend>Doubles from 5-away</legend>
                                <p>Position #1, Sort D, scroll to 5-away doubling.  All double-takes, where the doubles are just about as strong as they are for money (in the mid .4s compared to .5) and the takes at -5,-5 or higher are fairly close (.01 to .05).  I'm surprised they are that close.  Yes, they are bigger takes than for money, but not much bigger.  I had internalized that there was this big change from -5 to -4, since at -4 you can win with a doubled gammon.  Therefor, I thought, you're much more inclined to take when 5-away offers a non-gammonish cube since you don't want to let him get to 4-away cheaply.</p>
                                </p>However, compare to position #2.  Now the taker wins 21.6% instead of 25%, and doesn't get an automatic recube.  Nevertheless, the takes here are much bigger, crossing into the .1 range.  This can't just be a function of 4-away being so attractive since that should have been true in position #1.  So I think what is really going on here is that the potential recube to 4 is just so juicy when it happens.  And we can look -- sort by taker and look at what happens when 5-away is recubed to 4.  Massive passes (position #1 or #2).  It seems it's that potential recube that makes taking 5-away's cube so attractive in position #2 (and which can never happen in position #1).</p>

                                    <p>Here's something different.  Say you're leading 2-0 in a 7 point match.  You accept an initial cube and turn the game around into a race that you're winning.  When do you recube?</p>
                                    <p>Check out position #2, -5,-7, recube to 4.  I'll wait.</p>
                                    <p>It's a recube by only .001.  Can we infer that all non-gammon non-last-roll positions become correct recubes at this score just as they approach being money passes?  Well, click Next for position #3.  Here's a post ace-point position with a checker on the bar that also happens to be a non-gammon non-last-roll position that's borderline Take/Pass for money.  And at -5,-7, the recube to 4 is correct by just .01.  We may have a factoid here.  I'm guessing there are a few more in these tables waiting to be discovered.

                        <p>By hand.  (Just kidding.)</p>
                        <p>XG creator, Xavier Dufaure de Citres, showed me how to hack a text-based match file -- how to modify the score and cube-level at will between and within games -- in a way that XG will accept.  So I created a 372-game match.txt file that takes a single position through all scores and cube-levels within a 13 point match.  XG would import the txt file and analyze the "match", then export the results to an html directory.  I wrote python scripts to scrape the data from the html files and organize it into tables for the website.</p>
                        <p>All in all the process takes about five minutes of script-running split before and after the XG analysis, while the XG analysis takes about 90 minutes to do a single position at XG Roller ++.  
                        <p>Technical note: I collected the Money Cube Action data with Jacoby turned <strong>off</strong> because I wanted to make the most direct comparison to score-based data, and we don't use Jacoby in matches.</p>

                                    <p>I had initially thought analysis strentgh shouldn't really matter since what I wanted to focus on was the change in analysis due to match-score.  But some Janowski posts lead me to believe that better analysis leads to better tuning to the score as well.  Also, I'm seeing a spread of .05 between XG Roller ++ and 3-ply rollout even in races.  Even if that spread were randomly distributed, it would make the data much fuzzier.  I'm inclined to re-run with rollouts, after getting a round of feedback.</p>

                    <legend>The Opening Roll</legend>
                    <p>After some five-thousand years of backgammon, we're now pretty sure we know how to play the opening rolls.  When I started playing, twenty-five years ago,  . . . not so much.<br><br>
                    In 1990 a 53 was often played 24/21 13/8, and a 32 was always played 13/10, 13/11.  But you don't have to make those mistakes . . .</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"   >
                    <legend>The Naturals (31, 42, 53, 61, 65)</legend>
                    <p><strong>31, 42, 53,</strong> and <strong>61</strong> all make good points. <strong>65</strong> runs a checker to safety.  These plays are clearly correct for money and at all match scores.  Don't give any thought to these plays -- just make them.<br><br>
                    (64 also makes a point but not a good one, so it does not belong in this group but in the "The Other Sixes" below.)</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"   >
                    <legend>The Other Sixes (62, 63, 64)</legend>
                    <p>The proper play for <strong>62, 63</strong>, and <strong>64</strong> is for the back checker to play the 6 to the opponent's bar, and for the remaining number to come off the midpoint into your outer board.<br><br>
                    Yes, the back checker is vulnerable to both 1s and 6s, but when hit it is not sent all that far back and there are often lots of return shots that send the opponent much further back.  When not hit, you have a good chance to make a great advanced anchor.<br><br>
                    This play is clear for 62 and 63.  For 64, the alternatives of 24/14 and 8/2 6/2 are plausible.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"   >
                    <legend>The Other Aces (21, 41, 51)</legend>
                    <p>Should you slot the best point on the board with 6/5, or take less risk with 24/23?  The plays have gone in and out of fashion like pleated pants.  But now we know.<br><br>
                    <strong>Slot with 21.  Split with 41 and 51.</strong><br><br>
                    The problem with slotting a 51 is that with only aces and threes to cover, there are twelve numbers that fail to make the five point next turn.  The problem with slotting a 41 is that your opponent has four more chances to hit something and your position is already strong without the risk.  The 21 slot has the best risk-to-reward ratio: No new shot numbers and seven more covers.<br><br>
                    (Admittedly, the 21 decision is close enough to be regarded as a virtual tie.  Split if you feel like it.  The 41 and 51 decisions are not quite that close, but close enough that many strong players prefer to slot since the resulting games are more complex.)</p>

                    <strong>It turns out that splitting is correct in all cases.</strong>  (Except for 43, which is virtually tied.)<br><br>
                    For 32 and 43, split with the three, and move the two / four from the midpoint.  For 52 and 54, the five must be played from the midpoint and the other number splits.</p>

                    <legend>The Four Scores</legend>
                    <p>Match play is tricky.  Every score is different.<br><br>
                    A good place to start is with the four canonical scores: Money, Double Match Point, Gammon Go, and Gammon Save.  You're already familiar with Money play (see the Opening Money deck).  This section will go over the properties of Double Match Point, Gammon Go, and Gammon Save.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"   >
                    <legend>Double Match Point (DMP)</legend>
                    <p>Each player needs only one point to win the match. This will be the last game.  Gammons are irrelevant.  Opening rolls are nearly identical to Money plays, and the two differences are tiny.<br><br>
                    With <strong>64</strong>, run all the way with 24/14 instead of splitting.  Perhaps this is because the 18pt anchor goes down in value when you have no fear of being gammoned, but splitting is still close enough to make no real difference.<br><br>
                    With <strong>41</strong>, slot with 13/9 6/5 instead of splitting.  The difference here is even smaller.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"   >
                    <legend>Gammon Go (GG)</legend>
                    <p>You trail -2, -1 Crawford, so there is no cube this game.  Losing a gammon doesn't hurt you any more than losing a plain game in that either will lose the match.  But <strong>winning</strong> a gammon helps you a great deal.<br><br>
                    This means you have little interest in splitting (which can lead to a gammon-protective advanced anchor), and lots of interest in slotting and building (which give you better chances for winning a gammon).<br><br>
                    The Naturals all play the same.<br>
                    The Other Aces all <strong>slot</strong>.<br>
                    The Build/Splits all <strong>build.</strong><br><br>
                    The Other Sixes:<ul><li>62 slots the five point!  (Many strong players forget this over the board.)</li><li>63 still splits.</li><li>64 makes the two point.</li></ul></p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"   >
                    <legend>Gammon Save (GS)</legend>
                    <p>You lead -1, -2 Crawford, so there is no cube this game.  Winning a gammon doesn't help you any more than winning a plain game in that either will win the match.  But <strong>losing</strong> a gammon hurts you a great deal.<br><br>
                    This means you have great interest in splitting (to make a bid for an advanced anchor), and little interest in slotting and building.<br><br>
                    The Naturals all play the same.<br><br>
                    The Other Aces all <strong>split</strong> . . . except that 21 still wants to slot by a tiny margin.  So in fact, Other Aces also play the same as money.<br><br>
                    The Build/Splits all <strong>split.</strong><br><br>
                    The Other Sixes <strong>split</strong> (just like money), except for 64 where running is slightly better.</p>

                    <p>The general idea is to determine whether a particular score plays more like <strong>$$, DMP, GG,</strong> or <strong>GS</strong>.  And the <em>general</em> idea there is that a big lead translates to Gammon Save while a big deficit translates to Gammon Go.<br><br>

                    <p>We're familiar with <strong>-2,-1 Crawford</strong> (Gammon Go).  The trailer really wants to win a gammon for the match.  That gammon is worth twice as much as it is for money.<br><br>
                    So what about <strong>-3,-1C</strong>?<br>
                    Interestingly, in this case a gammon is nearly worthless for the trailer.  Consider: If the trailer wins one point the score will be -2, -1 <strong>Post</strong> Crawford, which means the trailer can double and make the next game worth two points.  This result is nearly identical to the trailer winning two points and getting to -1, -1.  In either case, the next game will be for the match.  So this score plays just like DMP.  (Yes, a backgammon is very helpful at -3,-1C.  But backgammons are rare, and seem not to affect opening play the way gammons do.)<br><br>
                    <strong>-4 -1C</strong>?<br>
                    Things are different once again.  Now the trailer wants a gammon, but only by the same degree as for money (half as much as at GG).  So at this hybrid score, the trailer doesn't need an advanced anchor to prevent gammons, but is only normally aggressive in producing gammons.<br><br>
                    <strong>-5-1C; -7-1C; -9,-1C</strong> (etc) all play like DMP for the same reasons given above.<br><br>
                    <strong>-6,-1C; -8-1C</strong> (etc) all play like the hybrid -4, -1C described above.</p>

                    <legend>Post-Crawford Scores</legend>
                    <p><strong>-1, -2 Post Crawford</strong><br>
                    When the leader opens he should assume the trailer will double next roll and make this game worth the match.  So the leader should play as though at <strong>DMP.</strong>  (There are two cases where he should <strong>pass</strong> the trailer's double and play the next game for the match: <strong>51</strong> and <strong>43.</strong>)<br><br>
                    The trailer has some counter-intuitive opening plays at this score.  You might think he should play more aggressive since he is behind, but this turns out not to be the case.  What happens after he slots his opening 21?  There are two variations to consider.  First, suppose the leader now rolls poorly and fails to hit the slot.  Now the trailer will double and the leader has a clear pass (preferring to play an even game for the match instead of this one).  Second, suppose the leader instead hits the slot.  The trailer will still double and the leader will take.  What we see is that the trailer gets stuck with the downsides of slotting, but never gets to keep the rewards.  If the slot works, the leader will pass the double.  So at this score, the trailer should not make high-variance plays like slotting and building which can only go wrong when blots are hit.  Instead, the trailer should open by <strong>splitting</strong> (or even playing two up), in order to grab a small gain with minimal risk.<br><br>
                    <strong>-1, -3 Post Crawford</strong><br>
                    When the leader opens he should assume the trailer will double next roll which will make this game Gammon Save-ish for the leader.  So he should play as though at GS from the start.<br>
                    Similarly, when the trailer opens he should assume he will double next roll producing Gammon Go, so he should open as though at Gammon Go.<br><br>
                    <strong>-1, -4 Post Crawford</strong><br>
                    The leader should open as though at <strong>GS</strong>, while the trailer should open by splitting as described above for -1, -2.<br><br>
                    <strong>-1, -5 Post Crawford</strong><br>
                    Gammon Save for the leader and Gammon Go for the trailer.</p>

                    <legend>Pre-Crawford</legend>
                    <p>The score <strong>-2, -2</strong> is likely to become DMP after an early cube turn, so it should be played like DMP from the start.<br><br>
                    Other even scores (<strong>-3, -3; -4, -4; -5, -5</strong>) are generally Money-ish.<br><br>
                    Any lead in a five-point match is potentially significant, pushing Money-like plays closer to GG or GS-like plays.  Factors that influence where a score lies on the continuum from Money to GG/GS:<ul><li>Size of lead</li><li>Distance from end of match</li><li>Gammon efficiency</li></ul>
                    So <strong>-3, -5</strong> is more polarized than <strong>-4, -5</strong> (size); <strong>-2, -3</strong> is more polarized than <strong>-4, -5</strong> (distance); and <strong>-2, -4</strong> is the most polarized of all given the size of the lead, the closeness to the end, and the perfect efficiency of gammons winning the match for the trailer.  For example, -2, -4 is the only Pre-Crawford score where the trailer slots with an opening 62.</p>

                    <legend>Why Bearoffs?</legend>
                    <p>You may or may not find late bearoffs fun, but you can't deny their importance.  Mistakes can swing a ton of equity, and the cube is usually already in play.  You want to know what you're doing.<br><br>
                    Also, these positions tend to illustrate cube theory fundamentals which is great training for beginners.<br><br>
                    The notes below assume you understand how to count rolls in 36, why there are 11 ways to roll an ace, and that you generally need 25% winning chances to take a cube.  For a good introduction to these topics, <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://www.bkgm.com/articles/Townsend/BasicsOfBackgammon2.html', '_system', 'location=no')">try this article.</a><br><br>

                    <p><strong>Last-roll bearoff</strong><br>
                    White doubles.  Can Red take?<br><br>
                    <img src='inappimages/HintImages/2x2DT.png' alt='image' style='width:50%; max-width:300px'><br><br>
                    White will win unless he rolls an ace.  Since there are eleven aces, Red can take.  (Remember, Red needs 25%, or 9 out of 36 rolls.  11 wins gives him a comfortable margin.)<br><br><br>
                    <strong>Two-roll bearoff</strong><br>
                    White doubles.  Can Red take?<br><br>
                    <img src='inappimages/HintImages/2x2DP.png' alt='image' style='width:50%; max-width:300px'><br><br>
                    This time we need to count two-roll sequences out of 36 x 36 = 1296.  Our take criterion is 1/4 of 1296 = 324.<br><br>
                    For Red to win, two things must happen: White must miss, then Red must not miss.  White wins on roll 17 times, leaving 19 misses.  After those 19 misses, Red wins 17 times.  19 x 17 = 323, so this is a bare, bare, pass.<br><br>
                    There is additional complexity when Red gets to redouble after White misses.  See <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://www.bkgm.com/articles/Kleinman/CubOffsAndTheCrippledCube/index.html', '_system', 'location=no')">this classic Kleinman essay</a> for a helpful shortcut.</p>

                    An n-roll position is one in which each side needs n rolls to bear off, assuming that no one rolls a set of doubles.  So three (or four) checkers on the ace v. three (or four) checkers on the ace is a <strong>2-roll</strong> position; five (or six checkers) on the ace v. five (or six) checkers on the ace is a <strong>3-roll</strong> position, etc.<ul><li>2- and 3-roll positions are <strong>passes.</strong></li><li>4-rolls and beyond are <strong>takes.</strong></li><li>5-rolls and beyond are <strong>initial doubles</strong> only.</li></ul>What does this tell us about three-checker bearoffs?

                    <p>Say you're leading <strong>3-away, 4-away</strong> and your opponent redoubles to <strong>4.</strong>  If you take, this game will decide the match.  If you pass, you'll trail <strong>-3,-2.</strong>  So you should take if your winning chances in this game are better than your winning chances at -3,-2.<br><br>
                    But what <em><strong>are</strong></em> your winning chances at -3,-2?  That's what a Match Equity Table will tell you.<br><br>

                    <legend>Neil's Numbers</legend>
                    <p>Neil Kazaross came up with a wonderful method to easily derive most of the values of the Match Equity Table.  Here's how it works:<br>
                    <table class='tablehintclass table-stripe' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black; width:auto'><tr><th colspan='8' align='center'>Neil's New Numbers</th></tr><tr><th align='left'>Trailer</th><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th align='left'>Neil</th><td>7.5</td><td>7.0</td><td>6.5</td><td>6.0</td><td>5.67</td></tr></table><br>
                    For a given match length remaining (Trailer value), Neil's Number estimates the advantage conferred by each point of the leader's margin.  For example:<br><br>
                    <strong>-6,-4</strong>: Trailer needs 6 so NN = 7.0 (see table).  Leader's margin is 2, so advantage is 7 x 2 = 14.  Leader's winning chances are 50 + 14 = <strong>64%.</strong>  Trailer's winning chances are 50 - 14 = <strong>36%.</strong>  (Actual values are 64.28 and 35.71.)<br><br>
                    <strong>-8,-3</strong>: Trailer needs 8 so NN = 6.0 (see table).  Leader's margin is 5, so advantage is 6 x 5 =30.  Leader's winning chances are 50 + 30 = <strong>80%.</strong>  Trailer's winning chances are 50 - 30 = <strong>20%.</strong>  (Actual values are 80.47 and 19.53.)<br><br>
                    <strong>Limitations:</strong> Doesn't work when Trailer needs 4 or fewer, or when Leader needs 2 or fewer.  For example, NN predicts that <strong>-5,-2</strong> should be 72.5% for Leader, when in fact it is 74.36%.  Neil advises simple memorization for scores that close to the end of a match.<br><br>

                    <table class='tablehintclass table-stripe' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black; width:auto'><tr><th colspan='8' align='center'>When Leader Needs 2</th></tr><tr><th align='left'>Trailer</th><td width='10'>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th align='left'>Actual %</th><td>74.4</td><td>79.9</td><td>84.2</td><td>87.5</td><td>90.2</td></tr><tr><th align='left'>NN %</th><td>72.5</td><td>78.0</td><td>82.5</td><td>86.0</td><td>89.7</td></tr></table><br>
                    Neil's Numbers are consistently off for these 2-away scores.  But the key word here is <em><strong>consistently.</strong></em>  When trailer needs 5-8, just add 2 to the Leaders win percentage to get an accurate result.<ul><li>72.5 + 2 = 74.5 which estimates 74.4</li><li>78.0 + 2 = 80.0 which estimates 79.9</li><li>82.5 + 2 = 84.5 which estimates 84.2</li><li>86.0 + 2 = 88.0 which estimates 87.5</li></ul>
                    You'll have to remember <strong>not</strong> to use this adjustment for -9,-2 where it isn't needed.  (In fact, when using NN to estimate -10,-2 and beyond, you'll need to <em>subtract</em> from the Leader's advantage.  But let's restrict our focus to the 9-point table.)<br><br>
                    <strong>B.</strong><br><br>
                    With the adjustment above in mind, we can accurately extend the Neil's Numbers table for Trailer values of 3 and 4:<br><br>
                    <table class='tablehintclass table-stripe' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black; width:auto'><tr><th colspan='8' align='center'>Neil's New Numbers Extended</th></tr><tr><th align='left'>Trailer</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><th align='left'>Neil</th><td>8.0</td><td>7.5</td><td>7.5</td><td>7.0</td><td>6.5</td><td>6.0</td><td>5.67</td></tr></table><br>
                    For example, <strong>-4,-3</strong> gives 57.5% for the Leader (actual value is 57.2%), and <strong>-4,-2</strong> gives 67% for the Leader (actual value is 66.9%).<br><br>
                    This extended table along with the "+2 for 2-away" rule (excluding -9,-2) gives accurate results for the entire 9-point Match Equity Table, save for the 1-away Crawford equities.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"  >
                    <legend>Crawford Equities</legend>
                    <p>Due to the peculiarities of the Crawford Rule, the Crawford Equities are their own thing and follow none of the patterns that regulate the rest of the table.  They are best off memorized separately.  Fortunately, there aren't that many of them:<table class='tablehintclass table-stripe' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black'><tr><th colspan='8' align='center'>Crawford Win %</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>75</td><td>81</td><td>84</td><td>89</td><td>91</td><td>93</td><td>94</td></tr></table><br>
                    So <strong>-1,-3c</strong> is 75%, and <strong>-1,-6c</strong> is 89%.  But how to memorize these numbers?<br><br>
                    Well, can you memorize the phone number 763-5221?  Great, you're almost done.  Next memorize the first value on the table: <strong>-1,-2c</strong> = 68%.<br><br>
                    Now, if you want to get the next number in the sequence, add the first digit of the phone number to 68: 68 + 7 = 75.  Add the next digit to get the next number: 75 + 6 = 81.<br><br>
                    So, what's <strong>-1,-8?</strong><br>
                    68 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 93.</p>

                    <p><table class='tablehintclass' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black'><tr><th>Risk / (Risk + Gain)</th></tr></table><br>
                    This calculation provides your Gammonless Raw Take-Point for both Money <em><strong>and</strong></em> Match-Play.  Let's start with the simple case:<br><br>
                    <strong>Money:</strong> You are doubled to 2.  There are three possible outcomes:<br><br>
                    <table class='tablehintclass' cellspacing='5'><tr><td>Take-Win:</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Pass:</td><td>-1</td></tr><td>Take-Lose:</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><ul><li><strong>Risk</strong> is the extra amount you might lose by taking instead of passing, in this case the difference between -1 and -2 = <strong>1</strong>.</li><li><strong>Gain</strong> is the extra amount you might win by taking instead of passing, in this case the difference between +2 and -1 = <strong>3</strong>.</li><li><strong>Risk / (Risk + Gain)</strong> is <strong>1 / (1 + 3)</strong> or <strong>1/4</strong> or <strong>25%.</strong></li></ul>This is one of many ways to derive your standard 25% take-point.<br><br>
                    <strong>Match-Play:</strong> You lead <strong>-3,-4</strong> and have already doubled to 2.  There were unpleasantries, and now you are redoubled to 4.  Again, there are three possible outcomes:<br><br>
                    <table class='tablehintclass' cellspacing='5'><tr><td>Take-Win:</td><td>(Win match)</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Pass:</td><td>(Trail -3,-2)</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>Take-Lose:</td><td>(Lose match)</td><td>0%</td></tr></table><br>
                    (The 40% value for -3,-2 comes the Match Equity Table.)<ul><li><strong>Risk</strong> is the difference between 40% and 0% = <strong>40%</strong>.</li><li><strong>Gain</strong> is the difference between 100% and 40% = <strong>60%</strong>.</li><li><strong>Risk / (Risk + Gain)</strong> is <strong>40% / (40% + 60%)</strong> or <strong>40/100</strong> or <strong>40%.</strong></li></ul>Observations:<ul><li>This calculation ignores gammons and recubes.  Recubes are discussed below.</li><li>The 40% comes from the Match Equity Table.  This is why you memorize a Match Equity Table.</li><li>The 40% take-point at this score is radically different from 25%.  Not understanding this will cost you a lot of matches.</li><li>More complicated examples are discussed below.</li></ul></p>

                    <legend>A More Complex Example</legend>
                    <p>You trail <strong>-4,-3</strong> and are doubled to 2.  There are three possible outcomes:<br>
                        <table class='tablehintclass' cellspacing='5'><tr><td>Take-Win:</td><td>(Lead -2,-3)</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>Pass:</td><td>(Trail -4,-2)</td><td>33.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Take-Lose:</td><td>(Trail -4,-1c)</td><td>18.6%</td></tr></table><ul><li><strong>Risk</strong> is the difference between 33.1% and 18.6% = <strong>14.5%</strong>.</li><li><strong>Gain</strong> is the difference between 60% and 33.1% = <strong>26.9%</strong>.</li><li><strong>Risk / (Risk + Gain)</strong> is <strong>14.5% / (14.5% + 26.9%)</strong> or <strong>14.5 / 41.4</strong> or <strong>35%.</strong></li></ul>Why is this a more complex example?<ul><li>The math is harder.  The math is easy when taking the cube means that win-or-lose, the game will decide the match.  Then your take point is simply the match equity you get from passing.  Here, however, you have to divide 14.5 by 41.4 in your head.</li><li>35% is not the complete answer, because it does not take <em><strong>recube equity</strong></em> into account.  See below . . . </li></ul></p>

                    <legend>Dead Cube v. Live Cube</legend>
                    <p>You trail <strong>-4,-3</strong> and are doubled to 2.<br>
                    <table class='tablehintclass' style='border:1px solid black; width:auto' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5'><tr><th align='left' width='100'>Dead Cube</th><th>Live Cube</th></tr><tr><td>35.2%</td><td>21.1%</td></tr></table><br>
                    We calculated the <strong>Dead Cube</strong> value in the section above.  It's your true take point in situations where you will never be able to redouble.  For example, the last-roll bearoff below is an easy take for money with 11/36 wins = 30.55%  But when trailing <strong>-4,-3</strong> you must pass since your wins are below 35% and you will never get to redouble.<br><br>
                    <img src='inappimages/HintImages/2x2DT.png' alt='image' style='width:50%; max-width:300px'><br><br>
                    <strong>Live Cube</strong> covers all the other cases where you <em>will</em> be able to redouble.  Since having access to a live cube is a benefit, a Live Cube take point will be lower than a Dead Cube take point.  The difference between the two is a measure of the power of the upcoming recube.  In this case, we already know the recube is particularly powerful: 3-away's take point on the recube is a very high 40% (see Take Point Basics).  That accounts for the large difference between the Dead Cube and Live Cube values on this initial double.<br><br>
                    Observations:<ul><li>The Live Cube value calculation is based on the simplifying assumption of perfectly efficient recubes.  In real life, recubes are rarely perfectly efficient.  So your <em><strong>actual</strong></em> take point lies somewhere between the Dead Cube and Live Cube values.  For instance, in a long race at this score of <strong>-4,-3</strong>, your actual take point on the initial cube seems to be just above <strong>24%.</strong></li><li>Live Cube take points are generally hard to calculate.  Instead, your goal might be to develop a feel for how powerful the recube will be, and thereby estimate difference between the Dead Cube and Live Cube values.</li></ul></p>

                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"  >
                    <legend>Automatic Recubes</legend>
                    <p>The Live Cube take point can be easily calculated in cases involving Automatic Recubes:<br><br>
                    You trail <strong>-5,-2</strong> and are doubled to 2.  If you take and get another turn, you will immediately redouble since you have nothing extra to lose.  Let's compare the last-roll (Dead Cube) case with the non-last-roll (Live Cube) case:<br>
                    <table class='tablehintclass' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black; width:auto'><tr><th></th><th>Dead</th><td width=60></td><th>Live</th></tr><tr><th style='text-align:left'>T-W</th><td>-3,-2</td><td>40%</td><td>-1,-2c</td><td>68%</td></tr><tr><th style='text-align:left'>Pass</th><td>-5,-1c</td><td>15.8%</td><td>-5,-1</td><td>15.8%</td></tr><tr><th style='text-align:left'>T-L:</th><td>Lose</td><td>0%</td><td>Lose</td><td>0%</td></tr></table><br>
                    On the last roll with a <strong>Dead Cube</strong>, your take point is 15.8 / 40 = <strong>39.5%</strong>.  You need to be <em>very</em> cautious to take a match-losing cube when your wins remain at the two-level.<br><br>
                    With a <strong>Live Cube</strong> and an Automatic Redouble, your take point is 15.8 / 68 = <strong>23.2%</strong><br><br>
                    This Live Cube is easy to calculate exactly because you don't have to worry about recube efficiency.  You will simply redouble as soon as you can.</p>

                    <legend>When Not To Do Math</legend>
                    <p>Learning how to calculate take points is essential for tournament backgammon.  Learning when <em><strong>not</strong></em> to is just as important.  Watch the top players.  For the most part, you simply won't see that much mental arithmetic.  Here's why:<ul><li>Study and memorize all take points within the <strong>Five-Point match.</strong>  There aren't all that many of them and they come up <em>all</em> the time.  Confirm that you know how to derive them, then use the flashcards to get them down pat.  You'll be glad you did.  (Kit Woolsey wrote this <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://www.bkgm.com/articles/GOL/Aug99/fivept.htm', '_system', 'location=no')">great article</a>  on all the cubes of the five-point match.  He used an earlier table, so his numbers are sometimes dated.  Highly recommended.)</li><li><strong>Cubes that will decide the match for either player.</strong>  As described above in Take Point Basics, these always reduce to the match winning chances you get from passing.</li><li><strong>Initial cubes outside the Five-Point match.</strong>These are all pretty close to money.  They may vary by a percent or two, but don't waste your time with them during a match.</li></ul>
                    So when <em>is</em> math called for?  Anytime outside these cases where a cube will swing a ton of equity.<br><br>
                    You're leading <strong>-3,-9</strong> and you took an early 2-cube.  You turned things around and played on throughout the middle game in hopes of a gammon.  The game resolved into a race and now you're thinking of cubing to 4, but you know to be wary of the automatic 8-cube you'll face after a take.  How conservative do you need to be?  What is his take point anyway?<br><br>
                    From his persepctive:<table class='tablehintclass' cellspacing='5'><tr><td>Take-Win:</td><td>(Lead -1c,-3)</td><td>75.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Pass:</td><td>(Trail -9,-1c)</td><td>5.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Take-Lose:</td><td>(Lose match)</td><td>0%</td></tr></table><br>
                    His take point is 5.6/75.1 = <strong>7.5%.</strong>  So you can't even think of redoubling until you're over 90% (or you get to the last roll).</p>

                        <p>At some point, you’ll want to learn the opening replies.  After all, each and every game will have a second roll so why not get it right?  The problem is that there are some 630 of them and many are not obvious.  How to come to terms with that much data?  How to memorize it for use over the board?<br><br>
                        You're holding the answer.  This app presents a complete system for understanding and memorizing all the money-game opening replies, and more.  Understanding comes in the form of a set of rules based on the key features of each position.  Memorization is achieved through flashcards.<br><br>
                        <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://www.fortuitouspress.com/replies', '_system', 'location=no')">This paper</a> describes the system in full detail and is strongly recommended.  The topics below provide a quick-start guide, and are a helpful reference while using the flashcards.</p>

                        <legend>How To Use These Decks</legend>
                        <p><strong>Non-Doubles</strong> and <strong>Doubles</strong> Replies are considered separately.  Each set has six Main Rules, and most rules have a number of Subrules.  The Rules and Subrules will usually point to the best play.  Occasionally, they will point to a play that is "close enough" (within .01 of the best play), which is called a <em>"substitution."</em>  On rare occasions the rules point to a play that is wrong by more than .01, which is called an <em>"exception."</em><br><br>Best Plays and Substitutions are grouped together in "Positions" decks, while Exceptions are treated separately in their own decks.<br><br>
                        <strong>Recommended study plan (for either Non-Doubles or Doubles):</strong><br><br>
                        <strong>Step 1: </strong>Learn the six Main Rules of one set.  Use the Rules Deck to help memorization.  (Ignore the Subrules at this stage.)  <br>
                        <strong>Step 2: </strong>Get familiar with the Subrules of that set.  Use the Rules Deck until you achieve a reasonable level of comfort.  Perfection is not required: you’ll get lots more practice in the next step.<br>
                        <strong>Step 3: </strong>Apply the Rules and Subrules to positions, using the "Positions" deck for this set.  Expect to spend some time going back and forth between the flashcards and these hints (or the main paper) to fully internalize how the rules work.  Remember, applying the rules will always get you to within .01 of the best play in this group.<br>
                        <strong>Step 4: </strong>Study the exceptions for this set on their own.  These plays are not rule-based and must be understood and memorized individually.  Fortunately, there aren't that many of them.<br>
                        <strong>Step 5: </strong>Combine Position and Excpetion decks of one set to train together.  You’ll know you’re ready when the exceptions stand out immediately from the rest of the pack.</p>

                        <p>Backgammon Giant <strong>Nack Ballard</strong> created a popular system for describing moves made near the beginning of the game, called <em>Nactation</em>.

                            <li><strong>D = Down</strong>: Bring both checkers down from the Midpoint.  32D = 13/10 13/11.</li>

                                    However, a new feature of the replies is the opportunity to <strong>hit</strong>.  Is hitting always correct?  It turns out there is a clear structure to your hitting priorities:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Hit Outside: </strong>Hit any blot outside your inner board.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Hit Inside: </strong>Hit loose on your 5 and 4 points.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    If none of these conditions apply, the position will fall into one of the following <em>mutually-exclusive</em> categories:

                                            <p>Rule 4 suggests splitting aces, unless after an opening slot or down.  Here are three exceptions when you roll a 21.  (Note that 21 is the most slottable of your aces -- the only one that should be slotted in the opening.)<br><br><img src='inappimages/HintImages/61P21.png' alt='image' style='width:100%; max-width:500px'><br><strong>61P 21: 13/11 6/5</strong><br>As stick writes, "If you split, how will you play your Sixes?"<br><br>

                                            One reason to split after an opening run is to create more hits when the advanced checker can't find safety.  But that doesn't apply when the advanced checker has already found safety.<br><br>
                                            <img src='inappimages/HintImages/51S21.png' alt='image' style='width:100%; max-width:500px'><br><strong>51S 21: 24/21</strong><br>
                                            A hard position.  You don't really want to split against a stacked position that is hoping to attack.  But you don't want to slot into a double-shot.  Best is the unusual 24/21.  Close behind is 13/11 6/5, which, depending on your opponent's expressiveness, may confer significant entertainment equity.</p>

Note that the outfield blot has both sixes and aces to find safety, so there is diminished utility in splitting to maximize hitting chances.</p>

                                            The worst time to make a deep point is when you're getting primed.<br><br>

                                            As above, avoid making your 2 point when you're in danger of being primed. (43S 64 provides an illustrative contrast: Opener has fewer good priming rolls, so making the deuce is best.)<br><br>

                                            Of all the opening runs, this outfield blot will have the hardest time finding safety.  65 is already safe, 64 has both aces and sixes, and 62 gets hit with your 64.  So this is the opening run against which you should play for contact.</p>

                                            In contrast to the above, splitting won't help you hit blots that aren't there.  Instead, cover the outfiled to hinder the last checker's escape.</p>

This case is a tactical exception.  Your blot on the 10 point is vulnerable to a 54, which already plays well by making the opposing 9 point.  And when your blot on the 10 point is hit, you have 5s to anchor and 3s and Aces to hit back.  If your blot is on the 9 point, you have 4s to anchor and 2s and 4s to hit back.</p>

                    <p>Backgammon is fundamentally a race, so evaluating races accurately is of fundamental importance.  Anyone relying on “feel” is needlessly throwing away gobs of equity.<br><br>
                    Accurate evaluation is a two-step process:
                    <ul><li>Count the race</li><li>Determine the cube action from the count.</li></ul>
                    Each step requires a little practice, though neither is particularly difficult.  If this material is new to you, your game is about to get a lot stronger.<br><br>

                    <legend>Counting</legend>
                    <p>The concept is straightforward.  A checker on the ace point is worth one pip.  A checker on the deuce point is worth two.  Two checkers on the three point are together worth six pips.  And so on.  Add up the pip totals for all the checkers of one player and you have that player’s pip count.  Then do the same for the other side.<br><br>
                    There are shortcuts.  My favorite is the <strong>Mental Shift</strong>: Imagine moving your checkers to transform your position into a mirror image of your opponent’s (which will then share the same pip counts), and keep track of how many pips you have to move.  If you have to move your checkers a net of seven pips forward to match the other position, then you must be seven pips behind in the race right now.  I find this method quick and painless, and use it every time.  Once I have the difference count, I can do an absolute count of one side (if needed).<br><br>

                    <p>You've counted the race.  Now what?<br><br>
                    The table below provides the cube actions for happy “low-wastage” racing positions where most all the checkers are on the 4, 5, and 6 points (or will be able to get there during the bear-in).  Unhappy racing positions, with stacks of checkers on the ace and deuce points, are neither covered by the table nor included in these decks.  As Tolstoy wrote, “All happy racing positions are alike; each unhappy racing position must be evaluated individually.”<br>

                    For example, when 73 doubles 83, 83 should pass because the number of pips she trails by (10) is one greater than the cutoff value provided in the table (9).<br><br>
                    <strong>Leader can redouble two pips shy of trailers point of last take, and can offer an initial double three pips shy of trailers point of last take.</strong><br><br>
                    For example, 73 considers offering a double.  Point of last take is 9 pips down (from the table), or a pip count of 82.  Leader can redouble against a pip count of 80 (two pips shy of point of last take) and can offer initial double against 79 (three pips shy of point of last take).<br><br>

                    <legend>Trice’s Rule 62</legend>
                    <p>The Cube Action Table above is not easy to memorize.  Fortunately, it can be constructed from some simple rules.  Here is Walter Trice's method, from page 136 of his <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://www.fortuitouspress.com/bootcamp', '_system', 'location=no')"><em>Backgammon Boot Camp</em>.</a><br><br>

                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For pip counts below 62:</strong><br>
                    Leader’s pip count.  Subtract 5, divide by 7, round down.<br><br>
                    For example:  Leader’s count is 43.  Subtracting 5 leaves 38.  Dividing by 7 leaves 5 point 4 something, which rounds down to 5.  Which is the value in the table.<br><br></li>

                    <li><strong>For pip counts above 62:</strong><br>
                    Leader’s pip count.  Divide by 10, add 1, round up.<br><br>
                    For example:  Leader’s count is 96.  Dividing by 10 leaves 9.6; adding 1 leaves 10.6; which rounds up to 11.  Which is the value in the table.
                </li></ol>

                    Simple.  Easy to use over the board.  Unfortunately, the second rule produces a number of answers that are off by one.  For example, Leader’s count is 79.  Dividing by 10 leaves 7.9; adding 1 leaves 8.9, which rounds up to 9.  But the actual value in the table is 10.<br><br>

                    Specifically, pip counts of 122, 121, and 61 produce values one too high, and pip counts 100, 90, 89, 80, 79, and 70 produce values that are one too low.<br><br>

                    What to do?  One path is to use Trice’s simple method and try to keep track of the exceptions.  At worst, you’ll be off by a pip.<br><br>

                    Another path is Nack's Rule 57, below.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset data-role="collapsible"  >
                    <legend>Nack’s Rule 57</legend>
                    <p>Nack Ballard's <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://www.bgonline.org/forums/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=59714', '_system', 'location=no')">Rule 57</a> is more accurate than Trice's Rule 62, at the expense of some more involved mental arithmatic.  The first part of the rule is the same as Trice's:<br><br>

                    <ol><li><strong>For pip counts below 57:</strong><br>
                    Leader’s pip count.  Subtract 5, divide by 7, round down.<br><br>
                    For example:  Leader’s count is 43.  Subtracting 5 leaves 38.  Dividing by 7 leaves “5 point 4 something, which rounds down to 5.  Which is the value in the table.<br><br></li>

                    <li><strong>For pip counts above 57:</strong></br>
                    Leader’s pip count.  Subtract 33, double, take nearest integer square root.<br><br>
                    For example:  Leader’s count is 79.  Subtracting 33 leaves 46; doubling leaves 92; nearest integer square root is 10.  Which is the value in the table.</li></ol>

                    More difficult to use over the board than Trice’s formula.  Mentally subtracting 33 is harder than adding 1.  Finding the nearest integer square root is considerably harder than rounding up.<br><br>

                    However, this formula is off by one in only one case, when Leader’s pip count is 111.  Subtracting 33 leaves 78, doubling leaves 156, nearest integer square root is 12.  The true value is 13.</p>

In this way, the book is accessable and informative to everyone.  (The dry humor and graceful clarity of the prose also help.)<br><br>

                    <legend>Basic Training</legend>
                    <p>The opening chapters of <em>Backgammon Boot Camp</em> concentrate, naturally, on the most fundamental and foundational concepts in backgammon.  These principles come up in every game.<br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-1 and 1-2)</strong> “The Trailing team should try to block the leading team and cause as much entanglement and general mayhem as possible.”  Or, per Kit Woolsey: “When ahead in the race, race.  When behind in the race, don't race.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-6 to 1-9)</strong> “Hitting two blots is often a very powerful play, even when the double hit compromises the hitter’s position . . . Black may succeed in Closing out White, or White may anchor.  The closeout usually leads to an easy win (Though accidents can still happen); but when White anchors, the game goes on, its character changed drastically.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-10 to 1-21)</strong> “If you want to learn to size up a backgammon position at a glance, start by looking at the anchors held by each side.  Ordinarily, the player with the more advanced anchor is winning.”  When might it be right to volunteer a shot?  When opponent is weak but improving, and when your lead is significant.  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-25 to 1-28)</strong> “If a checker must be placed within direct range of a hitter, it gets safer as it moves closer.  Never move into direct range if you can help it, but if you must, then move in as far as you can.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-29 to 1-32)</strong> “Paul Magriel gives a list of six criteria for distinguishing the situations when you should be making a bold play from those in which you should prefer a safe play.  They (my paraphrased version) are as follows:<ol>
                    <li>Opponent board strength.  The more points he has closed, the safer you tend to play.</li>
                    <li>Got an anchor?  With an anchor you can better handle getting hit, so you can play more boldly.</li>
                    <li>Your board strength.  With more points, play more boldly.</li>
                    <li>Blots in opponent’s board.  You don’t mind so much getting hit when there’s something to shoot at from the bar, so you can play more boldly.</li>
                    <li>Number of men you have back.  The more men you have back the less you mind having an additional man back, so the more boldly you can afford to play.</li>
                    <li>Number of men your opponent has back.  Similar to (5), when the other player has more men back, you need to play more conservatively.”</li></ol>
                    </p>

                    <legend>Advanced Training</legend>
                    <p>More general principles in this section, but with an emphasis on strategy over short-term tactics.<br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-1 to 2-2)</strong> “When the roll you have to play doesn’t lead to an immediate tactical goal, then strategic thinking becomes more important . . . there are really only three ways to win a game of backgammon: race, prime, and attack.  Formulating a game plan means, first of all, ranking these three routes to victory . . .” <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-3 to 2-12)</strong> “At the opposite end of the spectrum from burial we find what is known as purity.  A pure play is a play that keeps as many checkers as possible alive and active, either for making key points or for handling difficult rolls without making positional concessions . . . The Pure play is not always the right play.  But it is more likely to be the right play if either side has three or more men back.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-13 to 2-16)</strong> “It is as important to win 'won' positions as to get them in the first place.  It is frustrating to close out an opponent and then lose to some random shot in the bearoff.  No one can avoid all such occurances, but a little care and attention to detail will keep them to a minimum.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-17 to 2-21)</strong> “Tempo plays are easy to overlook because we tend to focus on constructive possibilities.  But when we have nothing constructive to do and an opponent has a lot of useful numbers coming up, such a play is always worth considering.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-22 to 2-31)</strong> “Duplication means giving your opponent two different ways to use the same number, as opposed to giving him different ways to use different numbers.  Duplication is not a tactical principle in its own right, but it is a very useful way to spot plays that limit your opponent’s opportunities on his next roll . . . If it is good to duplicate your opponent’s numbers, then it is (necessarily) bad to duplicate your own.”

                    <p>
                    <strong>(Positions 3-1 to 3-4)</strong> “Equity means the same thing in backgammon as elsewhere: it is the fair value of an asset . . . In a bear-off you can take a double when the odds against you are no worse than 3-to-1.  In other words, you can take when your chance of winning is 25% or greater.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 3-5 to 3-8)</strong> Recube equity can let you take with less than 25%.  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 3-9 to 3-13)</strong> N-Roll Bearoffs: <table class='tablehintclass table-stripe' cellspacing='5' cellpadding='5' style='border:1px solid black'><tr><th width='50' style='text-align:left'>Rolls</th><th width='60' style='text-align:left'>Win%</th><th style='text-align:left'>Cube Action</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>13.9%</td><td>Double - Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>21.2%</td><td>Double - Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>25.5%</td><td>Double - Take</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>28.3%</td><td>Double - Take</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>No Redouble - Take</td></tr></table><br>

                    <strong>(Positions 3-15 to 3-18)</strong> Effective Pip Count (epc) of a “rolls” position is 7n + 1.  So epc of a 3-roll position is 22.<br>
                    “Point of last take for the trailer is when he is down a number of effective pips equal to the number of rolls to go minus three.”<br>
                    “Certain oddball racing positions come up regularly in endgames.  For some of these, epcs can be readily estimated:<ol>
                        <li>Fourteen men off, one checker somewhere outside the home board: Pipcount + 4.7.</li>
                        <li>Thirteen off, two outside checkers: pipcount + 5.2.</li>
                        <li>Stack and straggler positions of the sort that result when one player closes out his opponent, gets hit late, and reenters: 3.5x(total checkers) + straggler pipcount."</li>

                    <p>Kit Woolsey's <em>Backgammon Encyclopedia</em> <b>did not</b> began as a series of online columns for GammonVillage, later to become argueably the most highly-regarded and best-selling backgammon book of its time.  Each short chapter introduces a concept such that a beginner can follow, but then develops that concept over five or so pages to places unfamiliar to many experts.  In this way, the book is accessable and informative to everyone.  (The dry humor and graceful clarity of the prose also help.)<br><br>
                    These decks include every position from Backgammon Boot Camp and more.  Find the position name at the bottom of the exposed answer text.

After analyzing Position 5, Walter wrote: "Shift White's spares down to the 4, 3, and 2 points and he has to pass."  Both positions 4-05 and 4-5b are included in the deck.</li>
                        <li>"BBC5-17-A" is Chapter 5, Position 17, where the uppercase "-A" indicates an alternate position not described in the text, but which I thought to be an instructive contrast to the original.</li>

                    <p>The opening chapters of <em>Backgammon Boot Camp</em> concentrate, naturally, on the most fundamental and foundational concepts in backgammon.  These principles come up in every game.<br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-1 and 1-2)</strong> “The Trailing team should try to block the leading team and cause as much entanglement and general mayhem as possible.”  Or, per Kit Woolsey: “When ahead in the race, race.  When behind in the race, don't race.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-6 to 1-9)</strong> “Hitting two blots is often a very powerful play, even when the double hit compromises the hitter’s position . . . Black may succeed in Closing out White, or White may anchor.  The closeout usually leads to an easy win (Though accidents can still happen); but when White anchors, the game goes on, its character changed drastically.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-10 to 1-21)</strong> “If you want to learn to size up a backgammon position at a glance, start by looking at the anchors held by each side.  Ordinarily, the player with the more advanced anchor is winning.”  When might it be right to volunteer a shot?  When opponent is weak but improving, and when your lead is significant.  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-25 to 1-28)</strong> “If a checker must be placed within direct range of a hitter, it gets safer as it moves closer.  Never move into direct range if you can help it, but if you must, then move in as far as you can.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 1-29 to 1-32)</strong> “Paul Magriel gives a list of six criteria for distinguishing the situations when you should be making a bold play from those in which you should prefer a safe play.  They (my paraphrased version) are as follows:<ol>
                    <li>Opponent board strength.  The more points he has closed, the safer you tend to play.</li>
                    <li>Got an anchor?  With an anchor you can better handle getting hit, so you can play more boldly.</li>
                    <li>Your board strength.  With more points, play more boldly.</li>
                    <li>Blots in opponent’s board.  You don’t mind so much getting hit when there’s something to shoot at from the bar, so you can play more boldly.</li>
                    <li>Number of men you have back.  The more men you have back the less you mind having an additional man back, so the more boldly you can afford to play.</li>
                    <li>Number of men your opponent has back.  Similar to (5), when the other player has more men back, you need to play more conservatively.”</li></ol>

                    <p>More general principles in this section, but with an emphasis on strategy over short-term tactics.<br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-1 to 2-2)</strong> “When the roll you have to play doesn’t lead to an immediate tactical goal, then strategic thinking becomes more important . . . there are really only three ways to win a game of backgammon: race, prime, and attack.  Formulating a game plan means, first of all, ranking these three routes to victory . . .” <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-3 to 2-12)</strong> “At the opposite end of the spectrum from burial we find what is known as purity.  A pure play is a play that keeps as many checkers as possible alive and active, either for making key points or for handling difficult rolls without making positional concessions . . . The Pure play is not always the right play.  But it is more likely to be the right play if either side has three or more men back.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-13 to 2-16)</strong> “It is as important to win 'won' positions as to get them in the first place.  It is frustrating to close out an opponent and then lose to some random shot in the bearoff.  No one can avoid all such occurances, but a little care and attention to detail will keep them to a minimum.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-17 to 2-21)</strong> “Tempo plays are easy to overlook because we tend to focus on constructive possibilities.  But when we have nothing constructive to do and an opponent has a lot of useful numbers coming up, such a play is always worth considering.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 2-22 to 2-31)</strong> “Duplication means giving your opponent two different ways to use the same number, as opposed to giving him different ways to use different numbers.  Duplication is not a tactical principle in its own right, but it is a very useful way to spot plays that limit your opponent’s opportunities on his next roll . . . If it is good to duplicate your opponent’s numbers, then it is (necessarily) bad to duplicate your own.”

                    <strong>(Positions 3-1 to 3-4)</strong> “Equity means the same thing in backgammon as elsewhere: it is the fair value of an asset . . . In a bear-off you can take a double when the odds against you are no worse than 3-to-1.  In other words, you can take when your chance of winning is 25% or greater.”  <br><br>
                    <strong>(Positions 3-5 to 3-8)</strong> Recube equity can let you take with less than 25%.  <br><br>

                    <strong>(Positions 3-15 to 3-18)</strong> Effective Pip Count (epc) of a “rolls” position is 7n + 1.  So epc of a 3-roll position is 22.<br>
                    “Point of last take for the trailer is when he is down a number of effective pips equal to the number of rolls to go minus three.”<br>
                    “Certain oddball racing positions come up regularly in endgames.  For some of these, epcs can be readily estimated:<ol>
                        <li>Fourteen men off, one checker somewhere outside the home board: Pipcount + 4.7.</li>
                        <li>Thirteen off, two outside checkers: pipcount + 5.2.</li>
                        <li>Stack and straggler positions of the sort that result when one player closes out his opponent, gets hit late, and reenters: 3.5x(total checkers) + straggler pipcount."</li>
